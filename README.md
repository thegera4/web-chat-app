This is a simple web chat app, where you can chat with one person in real time by clicking the "START A NEW CONVERSATION" button, and then writting the email of the person. It uses firebase authentication with google provider, and firestore database to save the conversations with all of your contacts. The UI was made with styled components and material UI. If you want to logout, just click in your avatar.
